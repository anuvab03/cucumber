Disease caused: Belly rot

Belly rot in cucumbers, caused by the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani, typically develops when cucumbers remain in prolonged contact with moist soil.

Treatment

1. Initial Stage: Prevention and Early Control
At the first signs of belly rot (small, water-soaked spots on the fruit), quick action is necessary to prevent further infection and protect unaffected cucumbers.

Cultural Practices:
✅ Improve Soil Drainage: Ensure proper water drainage to avoid excessive moisture.
✅ Use Mulching: Apply straw, plastic, or dry leaves as mulch to prevent cucumbers from touching wet soil.
✅ Adjust Irrigation: Water at the base of the plant in the morning to allow the soil to dry before nightfall.
✅ Increase Air Circulation: Space plants properly and prune excess leaves to enhance airflow.

Chemical Control in the Initial Stage:
Copper Oxychloride (50% WP) – Mix 2-3 g per liter of water and spray on plants and soil.
Chlorothalonil (75% WP) – Mix 2 g per liter of water and apply to affected areas.
Bacillus subtilis (Biofungicide) – Mix 5 ml per liter and use as a soil drench for a biological approach.
📌 Application Frequency: Every 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

2. Mid-Stage: Containment and Recovery
If the infection spreads, it is essential to contain the disease and limit damage to fruit and plants.

Field Management:
✔️ Remove Infected Fruits: Discard rotting cucumbers to prevent fungal spores from spreading.
✔️ Rotate Crops: Avoid planting cucumbers or similar crops (melon, squash) in the same area for consecutive seasons.
✔️ Improve Soil Health: Mix organic compost and Trichoderma-based biofungicides into the soil to reduce fungal activity.

Fungicide Application for Containment:
Azoxystrobin (23% SC) – Use 1 ml per liter and spray on plants and soil to protect unaffected cucumbers.
Fludioxonil (25% SC) – Use 0.5–1 ml per liter as a soil drench or foliar spray.
Mancozeb (75% WP) – Use 2.5 g per liter as a protective measure.
📌 Repeat spraying every 7 days until symptoms stop progressing.

3. Final Stage: Stopping the Disease Before Harvest
If belly rot has reached an advanced stage, the focus shifts to minimizing losses and ensuring safe harvest practices.

Final Management Steps:
🔹 Limit Further Spraying: Stop chemical fungicide application at least 15 days before harvest to avoid residue contamination.
🔹 Harvest Healthy Fruits Early: Picking cucumbers a bit earlier reduces exposure to soil and fungal infection.
🔹 Post-Harvest Cleaning: Wash harvested cucumbers in a mild potassium permanganate solution to kill any lingering fungal spores.
🔹 Field Sanitation: After the season, remove infected plant debris and disinfect soil using solarization (covering soil with plastic sheets to trap heat and kill pathogens).

Herbicide Use from Initial to Final Stages
Weed control is also essential to reduce fungal spread, as weeds can harbor belly rot pathogens.

Pre-Emergence Herbicide (Before Weeds Appear)
Pendimethalin (30% EC): Use 1-1.5 liters per acre mixed with 200-250 liters of water and spray evenly on the soil before cucumber seedlings emerge.
Post-Emergence Herbicides (For Growing Weeds)
Oxyfluorfen (23.5% EC): Apply 300-400 ml per acre to control young weeds.
Glyphosate (41% SL): Use 1-1.5 liters per acre for weeds in non-crop areas (avoid direct contact with cucumbers).
Paraquat (24% SL): Use 500 ml per acre in between rows but avoid spraying on cucumber plants.
Final Stage Weed Management:
Manually remove weeds near the harvest period to avoid herbicide residues on cucumbers.
Use organic mulches to suppress weed growth instead of chemical herbicides.
