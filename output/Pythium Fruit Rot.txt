Disease caused: Pythium Fruit Rot

Pythium fruit rot is a destructive fungal-like disease caused by Pythium spp. It primarily affects the fruit of cucumbers, especially those in direct contact with wet soil. The disease is characterized by soft, water-soaked lesions that expand rapidly, leading to fruit decay. It spreads quickly under humid and wet conditions, making it a major concern in greenhouses and open fields with poor drainage.

Treatment
Stage 1: Early Infection (Small Water-Soaked Spots on Fruits)
‚úÖ Symptoms:
Tiny water-soaked spots on fruit skin, usually where the fruit touches wet soil.
No visible fungal growth yet.
‚úÖ Action: Organic & cultural control to stop progression.
Options

1Ô∏è. Copper-Based Fungicide (Prevents fungal spread and strengthens fruit defenses)

2‚Äì3g copper hydroxide per liter of water.
Spray every 7‚Äì10 days, especially after rain.
Apply early morning or late evening to avoid sun damage.
2Ô∏è. Neem Oil Spray (Natural antifungal & bacterial suppressor)

5 ml neem oil + 2 ml mild liquid soap + 1L water.
Spray every 5‚Äì7 days, covering fruit and lower leaves.
3Ô∏è. Mulching (Prevents direct soil contact & moisture accumulation)

Use dry straw, plastic mulch, or dry grass clippings around the plant base.
üî∏ Additional Preventative Measures:

Prune lower leaves to improve air circulation.
Remove small infected fruits immediately.
Avoid watering in the evening to prevent prolonged wetness.
üîπ Stage 2: Moderate Infection (Expanding Lesions & Soft Fruit Tissue)
‚úÖ Symptoms:

Brown, mushy lesions on fruits.
White, cotton-like fungal growth appears in humid conditions.
Fruits start to collapse under pressure.
‚úÖ Action: Stronger organic treatments & soil management.

Treatment Options & Dosage
1Ô∏è. Potassium Bicarbonate Spray (Inhibits fungal growth & dries out infected areas)

5g (1 tsp) potassium bicarbonate + 2 ml liquid soap + 1L water.
Spray every 5‚Äì7 days, covering fruits and surrounding soil.
2Ô∏è. Biological Control: Trichoderma spp. (Suppresses Pythium in soil & on plant tissue)

2‚Äì4g Trichoderma spores per liter of water.
Apply every 2 weeks as a foliar spray & soil drench.
3Ô∏è. Hydrogen Peroxide Drench (For Soil Disinfection)

3% hydrogen peroxide solution diluted 1:3 with water.
Drench soil around infected plants every 10 days to kill spores.

üîπ Stage 3: Severe Infection (Full Fruit Decay, Vine & Root Infection)
‚úÖ Symptoms:

Fruits completely rotted, leaving soft, wet masses.
Foul odor from secondary bacterial infections.
Stem base starts rotting, leading to vine collapse.
‚úÖ Action: Chemical fungicides & emergency plant removal.

Treatment Options & Dosage
1Ô∏è. Systemic Fungicide: Metalaxyl (Highly Effective for Pythium)

1‚Äì2 ml per liter of water (as per product label).
Apply every 10‚Äì14 days, covering fruit, leaves, and soil.
2Ô∏è. Chlorothalonil-Based Fungicide (Protects surrounding healthy plants from infection)

2‚Äì3g per liter of water.
Spray every 7‚Äì10 days, avoiding excess application.
3Ô∏è. Fosetyl-Al (Aluminum-Based Fungicide, Root Protection)

3g per liter of water (as per label).
Soil drench every 14 days to protect roots.
