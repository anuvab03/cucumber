Disease caused: Downy Mildew

Downy mildew in cucumbers is caused by the fungal-like pathogen Pseudoperonospora cubensis. It spreads rapidly in humid conditions and appears as yellow angular spots on leaves, which later turn brown and dry out.

Treatment

1. Initial Stage: Early Detection & Prevention

Symptoms at the Initial Stage:
🔹 Yellow, angular spots on the upper leaf surface.
🔹 Grayish-purple mold (spores) on the underside of leaves, especially in humid weather.
🔹 Slight curling of leaves but no major leaf drop yet.

Cultural Practices for Early Control:
✅ Improve Airflow – Increase plant spacing and prune extra leaves to allow air circulation.
✅ Reduce Leaf Wetness – Use drip irrigation instead of overhead watering.
✅ Remove & Destroy Infected Leaves – Prevents disease spread to healthy plants.
✅ Avoid Waterlogging – Ensure proper drainage in the field.
✅ Apply Mulching – Use straw, plastic, or dry leaves to prevent fungal spores from splashing onto plants.

Organic/Biological Treatments:
🌱 Neem Oil (1%) – Mix 5 ml per liter of water and spray every 5–7 days.
🌱 Bacillus subtilis (Biofungicide) – Mix 5 ml per liter and apply as a foliar spray.
🌱 Potassium Bicarbonate (Natural Fungicide) – Use 5 g per liter and spray early in the morning to prevent fungal development.

Chemical Control in Early Stage:
At the first sign of infection, preventive fungicides should be applied.

✔ Chlorothalonil (75% WP) – Dosage: 2 g per liter, foliar spray every 7–10 days.
✔ Metalaxyl + Mancozeb (8% + 64% WP) – Dosage: 2.5 g per liter, spray every 10 days.
✔ Azoxystrobin (23% SC) – Dosage: 1 ml per liter, apply as foliar spray to stop spore germination.

📌 Spray early in the morning or late evening to avoid high temperatures.

2. Mid-Stage: Containment and Recovery
If downy mildew spreads to multiple leaves, take immediate steps to reduce fungal growth and protect healthy leaves.

Symptoms at the Mid-Stage:
🔸 Brown, necrotic (dead) patches appear on leaves.
🔸 More grayish spores visible on leaf undersides.
🔸 Leaves start curling and drying, but stems and fruits remain unaffected.

Field Management Practices:
✔️ Remove & Destroy Severely Infected Leaves – This helps slow down the disease.
✔️ Reduce Humidity Around Plants – Avoid excess watering and increase airflow by spacing plants.
✔️ Apply Protective Sprays Regularly – Rotate between different fungicides to prevent resistance.

Fungicide Treatment for Mid-Stage Infection:
1️⃣ Dimethomorph (50% WP) + Mancozeb (64% WP) – Dosage: 2 g per liter, apply every 7 days.
2️⃣ Fosetyl-Aluminum (80% WP) – Dosage: 2 g per liter, spray twice a month.
3️⃣ Cymoxanil (8%) + Mancozeb (64%) WP – Dosage: 2.5 g per liter, foliar spray every 10 days.

📌 Avoid applying fungicides right before rain, as they may wash away.

3. Final Stage: Stopping the Disease & Minimizing Losses
If the infection reaches an advanced stage, the goal is to reduce further damage and salvage the remaining crop.

Symptoms at the Final Stage:
🔻 Leaves turn completely brown and dry, leading to plant wilting.
🔻 Cucumbers may stop growing or appear deformed.
🔻 Disease spreads across the field, affecting multiple plants.

Management Practices in the Final Stage:
🚫 Stop Using Chemical Fungicides 15 days before harvest to avoid residue in fruits.
🚫 Avoid Overwatering – Keep soil moisture balanced but do not let it dry out completely.
✔️ Harvest Remaining Healthy Cucumbers Early – Reduces losses and prevents further spread.
✔️ Remove and Burn Infected Plants – Do not leave diseased plants in the field.
✔️ Deep Plowing After Harvest – Bury spores deep in the soil to reduce fungal survival.

Last-Stage Fungicide Treatment (Use Only If Needed):
Fluopicolide (62.5 g/l) + Propamocarb (625 g/l SC) – Dosage: 1 ml per liter, one final spray before stopping fungicide use.
Mandipropamid (23.4% SC) – Dosage: 1 ml per liter, spray as a final attempt to protect remaining plants.
📌 STOP chemical treatments at least 15 days before harvesting cucumbers!

4. Preventing Future Outbreaks
After controlling the infection, preventive measures are necessary for the next season.

✅ Use Disease-Resistant Varieties – Grow cucumber varieties resistant to downy mildew.
✅ Apply Preventive Fungicide Sprays – Before high-humidity periods.
✅ Rotate Crops – Avoid planting cucumbers in the same area for at least 2 years.
✅ Disinfect Tools & Equipment – Prevent fungal spores from spreading.
✅ Soil Solarization – Cover soil with plastic sheets for 4–6 weeks before planting to kill spores.
