Disease caused: Bacterial Wilt

Bacterial wilt in cucumbers is caused by the bacterium Erwinia tracheiphila, which is transmitted primarily by cucumber beetles. The disease causes wilting of leaves, yellowing, and plant death, leading to major yield loss.

Treatment

1. Initial Stage: Early Detection & Prevention
Symptoms of Bacterial Wilt at the Initial Stage:
🔹 Sudden wilting of one or two leaves, even when soil moisture is adequate.
🔹 Leaves may recover overnight but wilt again during the day.
🔹 Sticky, milky bacterial ooze from cut stems (a key test for identification).
🔹 Cucumber beetles (small yellow-green insects with black spots or stripes) present on plants.

Quick Test to Confirm Bacterial Wilt:
1️⃣ Cut a wilted stem near the base of the plant.
2️⃣ Slowly pull apart the cut ends – a sticky, thread-like bacterial ooze confirms bacterial wilt.

Cultural Practices for Early Control:
✅ Remove & Destroy Infected Plants – As soon as wilting is observed, uproot and burn infected plants to prevent the spread.
✅ Control Cucumber Beetles (Vectors) – Use yellow sticky traps and apply neem-based insecticides to reduce beetle populations.
✅ Use Floating Row Covers – Protect young plants from cucumber beetles by covering them with fine netting.
✅ Rotate Crops – Avoid planting cucumbers in the same area for at least 2 years to break the bacterial cycle.
✅ Increase Spacing & Airflow – Reduce moisture buildup by spacing plants at least 1.5 feet apart.

2. Mid-Stage: Containment & Reducing Spread
If bacterial wilt is spreading to multiple plants, focus on controlling vectors and limiting further infection.

Symptoms at the Mid-Stage:
🔸 More leaves wilting, spreading from one side of the plant to the entire vine.
🔸 Yellowing of leaves before they completely wilt.
🔸 Beetles actively feeding on leaves and stems, creating wounds that allow bacteria to spread.

Control Measures:
✔️ Spray Organic Insecticides – To control beetles, apply:

Neem Oil (1%) – Mix 5 ml per liter of water and spray every 5–7 days.
Spinosad (Bio-Insecticide) – Mix 1 ml per liter and spray to kill beetles.
✔️ Trap & Kill Cucumber Beetles – Use pheromone traps or hand-pick beetles early in the morning.
✔️ Apply Copper-Based Bactericides (Limited Effectiveness)
Copper Oxychloride (50% WP) – Mix 2 g per liter and spray every 10 days to reduce bacterial survival.
✔️ Prune & Dispose of Affected Vines – Remove infected vines to prevent spread.
3. Final Stage: Salvaging Healthy Plants & Preventing Future Infections
If bacterial wilt has spread to multiple plants, the focus shifts to stopping further transmission and protecting remaining healthy vines.

Symptoms at the Final Stage:
🔻 Entire plant wilts permanently and does not recover overnight.
🔻 Fruits stop growing or become deformed.
🔻 Cucumber beetles present in large numbers, feeding on multiple plants.

Management at the Final Stage:
🚫 STOP Chemical Spraying on Severely Infected Plants – No treatment can reverse advanced bacterial wilt.
🚫 Remove & Burn Infected Plants Immediately – Leaving them in the field will spread bacteria to healthy cucumbers.
✔️ Deep Plowing After Harvest – Bury infected plant debris to kill bacteria and beetles hiding in the soil.
✔️ Crop Rotation with Non-Host Crops – Avoid planting cucumbers, melons, or squash in the same field for at least 2 years.
✔️ Use Resistant Varieties in the Next Season – Some cucumber varieties are more resistant to bacterial wilt.
