Disease caused: Gummy Stem blight

Gummy stem blight is a fungal disease caused by Didymella bryoniae, primarily affecting cucumbers and other cucurbits like melons, squash, and pumpkins. 
It attacks the stems, leaves, and fruits, causing brown lesions, stem cracking, and a sticky, gummy exudate.

Treatment
🔹 Stage 1: Early Infection (Small Lesions, Slight Oozing on Stems & Leaves)
✅ Symptoms:
Small brown, water-soaked spots on leaves or stems.
Light gummy exudate (sticky sap) on stems.
✅ Action: Organic sprays & cultural control to stop fungal spread.

Treatment Options & Dosage
1️. Copper-Based Fungicide (Prevents fungal spread & boosts immunity)

2–3g copper hydroxide or copper oxychloride per liter of water.
Spray every 7–10 days, especially after rain or high humidity.
Apply early morning or late afternoon to avoid leaf burn.
2️. Neem Oil Spray (Mild antifungal & prevents secondary infections)

5 ml neem oil + 2 ml liquid soap + 1 liter water.
Spray every 5–7 days, covering both sides of leaves and stems.
Best applied late evening to avoid sun damage.
3️. Biological Control: Bacillus subtilis (Competes with fungus & boosts plant defenses)

5–10 ml per liter of water (as per product label).
Spray every 7–10 days, preferably in the evening.

Cultural Practices to Follow:

Prune infected leaves immediately and dispose of them far from the garden.
Avoid overhead watering; water at the base to prevent spore spread.
Ensure 6–8 hours of direct sunlight to prevent excessive humidity.
Rotate crops (don’t plant cucumbers in the same soil for at least 2 years).
 Stage 2: Moderate Infection (Large Lesions, Leaf Wilting, Spreading to Fruits)
✅ Symptoms:
Brown to black necrotic spots on stems and leaves.
More gum-like exudate oozing from infected areas.
Leaves start wilting even with adequate water.
Sunken, dark brown lesions on fruits, leading to rot.
✅ Action: Stronger organic fungicides & biological control to contain infection.

Treatment Options & Dosage
1️. Potassium Bicarbonate Spray (Kills spores & prevents new infections)

5g (1 tsp) potassium bicarbonate + 2 ml liquid soap + 1L water.
Spray every 5–7 days, covering stems, leaves, and fruit.
Apply early morning or late evening.
2️. Trichoderma-Based Biofungicide (Suppresses Didymella bryoniae in the soil and plant tissues)

2–4g Trichoderma spores per liter of water (as per product label).
Spray every 2 weeks, ensuring coverage of soil, stems, and leaves.
Use soil drench around plant bases to prevent root infection.
3️. Sulfur-Based Fungicide (Stops further fungal growth, best for moderate cases)

2–3g per liter of water.
Spray every 7–10 days, avoiding hot weather (above 30°C/86°F).
Best applied early morning or late afternoon.

🔹 Stage 3: Severe Infection (Stem Rot, Extensive Leaf Loss, Plant Collapse)
✅ Symptoms:

Large, dark sunken lesions on stems.
Leaves completely wilted and drying up.
Fruits rotting from brown to black lesions.
Stems cracking open, releasing excessive gummy exudate.
✅ Action: Chemical fungicides & emergency plant removal if necessary.

Treatment Options & Dosage
1️. Systemic Fungicide: Thiophanate-Methyl (Highly Effective for Severe Cases)

Use as per label instructions (typically 1-2 ml per liter of water).
Apply every 10–14 days, ensuring full plant coverage.
Stop use 2–3 weeks before harvest.
2️. Chlorothalonil-Based Fungicide (Protects healthy tissues from further infection)

2–3g per liter of water.
Spray every 7–10 days, covering both sides of leaves.
Apply late afternoon or early evening to minimize damage.
3️. Copper-Based Spray (Last-resort option, use only if symptoms persist after other treatments)

2–3g per liter of water.
Apply every 10 days, but avoid excessive use to prevent soil toxicity.
