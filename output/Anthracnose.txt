Disease caused: Anthracnose

Anthracnose in cucumbers is caused by the fungus Colletotrichum orbiculare and appears as small, water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits, which later turn brown and sunken. Treating it at the initial stage is crucial to prevent severe damage.

Treatment

1. Early Stage (Mild Infection - Few Spots on Leaves)
ðŸ”¹ Organic Approach (Recommended for Initial Control)

Neem Oil: 5 ml per liter of water (spray every 7-10 days).
Baking Soda Spray: 1 tsp baking soda + 1 liter of water + a few drops of liquid soap.
ðŸ”¹ Chemical Fungicides (If Needed)

Copper Oxychloride: 2-3 g per liter of water (spray every 10-12 days).
Chlorothalonil (Contact Fungicide): 2 g per liter of water (repeat after 7-10 days).
2. Moderate Infection (Several Leaves Affected, No Major Fruit Damage)
ðŸ”¹ Systemic & Contact Fungicide Mixture (Stronger Treatment)

Mancozeb 75% WP: 2-3 g per liter of water (every 7-10 days).
Azoxystrobin 23% SC: 1 ml per liter of water (every 10 days).
ðŸ”¹ Alternative Option

Copper Hydroxide 77 WP: 2 g per liter of water.
ðŸ‘‰ Spray in the early morning or late evening for better absorption.

3. Severe Infection (Widespread Damage on Leaves, Stems, and Fruits)
ðŸ”¹ Stronger Fungicide Combination

Propiconazole 25% EC: 1 ml per liter of water (apply every 7-10 days).
Azoxystrobin + Difenoconazole (Premix): 0.8-1 ml per liter of water.
Thiophanate-methyl 70% WP: 1 g per liter of water.
ðŸ‘‰ Alternate fungicides to prevent resistance.
ðŸ‘‰ Remove and burn heavily infected plants to stop the spread.

Herbicide Use (If Weeds are a Problem)
Pre-Emergence: Pendimethalin 30% EC (3-4 ml per liter of water).
Post-Emergence: Glyphosate 41% SL (5 ml per liter of water, carefully applied to weeds, not cucumber plants).
